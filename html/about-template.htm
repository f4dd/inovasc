    <h3>Introduction and Design</h3>

    <div style="float: left"><img src="../images/inovasc-design.png"></div>
    <p>
INOVASC development goals were pure simplicity. No Java, PHP, databases
or other session-enabling technology must be maintained. CGI technology allows for a rapid deployment in a multitude of environments, all it needs is a standard webserver.
    </p>
    <p>
The benefit is a centrally located vulnerability scan client that is accessible from anywhere with a web browser. The operation is kept so simple, even a non-IT person could start a scan.
    </p>
    <p>
INOVASC connects to the OpenVAS Scanner daemon openvassd using the OpenVAS Transfer protocol OTP. It downloads the scan configuration, provides a highlevel selection of security checks to  execute, starts a host scan and reports the scan results in HTML format. With the trade-off for not being able to "fine-tune" the scan settings, reliable results can be obtained quickly with minimal overhead. By supporting user logins for executing local checks, INOVASC implements credential-based scans for even more useful data.

    <p>
INOVASC has been developed for use with a Apache webserver under Linux,
connecting to a OpenVAS v4.x/v5.x server and is using libraries such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GNU libc</li>
      <li>OpenSSL</li>
      <li>CGIC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
To my best knowledge, I need to mention copyrights of the GPL, the OpenSSL
team (Mark J. Cox, Ralf S. Engelschall, Ben Laurie, Dr. Stephen Henson),
Thomas Boutell for the cgic library, and Renaud Deraison with the Tenable
Network Security team for the Nessus server software and protocol information.

    <p>
Thanks to the <a href="http://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS project</a> and their supporters, we have a <b>open</b>, powerful, flexible platform for vulnerability assessments that can be taylored to many needs.
