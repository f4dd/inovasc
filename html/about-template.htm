    <h3>Introduction</h3>

INOVASC development goals were pure simplicity. No Java, PHP, databases
or other enabling technology must be maintained. No cookies either. Just
plain CGI technology written in 'C'.
    </p>
    <p>
The benefit is a centrally located scan client that keeps all results in
one place. The design is kept so simple, even a non-IT person could start
a scan.

INOVASC has been developed for use with a Apache webserver under Linux,
connecting to a OpenVAS v4.x/v5.x server and is using libraries such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GNU libc</li>
      <li>OpenSSL</li>
      <li>CGIC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
To my best knowledge, I need to mention copyrights of the GPL, the OpenSSL
team (Mark J. Cox, Ralf S. Engelschall, Ben Laurie, Dr. Stephen Henson),
Thomas Boutell for the cgic library, and Renaud Deraison with the Tenable
Network Security team for the Nessus server software and protocol information.
