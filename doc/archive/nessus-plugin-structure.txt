(CVE-2008-2358); ; VFS in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22.16, and 2.6.23.x before; 2.6.23.14, performs tests of access mode by using the flag variable; instead of the acc_mode variable, which might allow local users to; bypass intended permissions and remove directories. (CVE-2008-0001); ; Linux kernel before 2.6.22.17, when using certain drivers that register; a fault handler that does not perform range checks, allows local users; to access kernel memory via an out-of-range offset. (CVE-2008-0007); ; Integer overflow in the hrtimer_start function in kernel/hrtimer.c; in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.10 allows local users to execute; arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (panic) via a large; relative timeout value. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from; third party information. (CVE-2007-5966); ; The shmem_getpage function (mm/shmem.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.11; through 2.6.23 does not properly clear allocated memory in some; rare circumstances related to tmpfs, which might allow local; users to read sensitive kernel data or cause a denial of service; (crash). (CVE-2007-6417); ; The isdn_ioctl function in isdn_common.c in Linux kernel 2.6.23; allows local users to cause a denial of service via a crafted ioctl; struct in which iocts is not null terminated, which triggers a buffer; overflow. (CVE-2007-6151); ; The do_coredump function in fs/exec.c in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6.x; up to 2.6.24-rc3, and possibly other versions, does not change the; UID of a core dump file if it exists before a root process creates; a core dump in the same location, which might allow local users to; obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2007-6206); ; Buffer overflow in the isdn_net_setcfg function in isdn_net.c in; Linux kernel 2.6.23 allows local users to have an unknown impact via; a crafted argument to the isdn_ioctl function. (CVE-2007-6063); ; The wait_task_stopped function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.8; checks a TASK_TRACED bit instead of an exit_state value, which; allows local users to cause a denial of service (machine crash) via; unspecified vectors. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from; third party information.
